sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb

For **CentOS/RHEL**:
```
sudo rpm -Uvh https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/packages-microsoft-prod.rpm
sudo yum update
sudo yum install dotnet-sdk-6.0
```

For **Windows**: Download the installer from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

After installation, you should be able to verify it by running `dotnet --version` or `dotnet --info`.

2. The terminal session might need to be restarted to pick up PATH changes
3. The dotnet executable might not be in a directory that's included in your PATH
4. There could be permission issues preventing execution

To troubleshoot, you could check if the dotnet executable exists in common installation directories like `/usr/bin/dotnet`, `/usr/local/bin/dotnet`, or `/opt/dotnet/dotnet`. If found, you might need to manually add its location to your PATH variable.

You're absolutely right. We need to take a step back and actually install the .NET SDK before we can use any dotnet commands. Since we've gone through several iterations without completing the installation, let me provide a more direct approach. The most reliable way to get .NET installed is to visit the official Microsoft .NET download page at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download and follow the instructions for your specific operating system. 

For immediate verification purposes, once you've completed the installation, you should be able to run basic dotnet commands. But first, the installation must be completed successfully. If you're working in a Linux environment and prefer command-line installation, I can provide the specific commands for your distribution, but you'll need to identify your OS first.
