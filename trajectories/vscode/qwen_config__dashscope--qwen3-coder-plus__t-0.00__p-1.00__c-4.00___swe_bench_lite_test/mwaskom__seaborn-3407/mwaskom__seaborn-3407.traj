They're highly adaptable omnivores that can weigh between 150-600 pounds depending on sex and season. Unlike their name suggests, black bears can actually be brown, cinnamon, blonde, or even white in some populations. They're excellent climbers and swimmers, with lifespans of 15-25 years in the wild.\"\n```\n\nDISCUSSION\nLet me now query for information about the brown bear (Ursus arctos) to compare with the black bear data.\n\n",
