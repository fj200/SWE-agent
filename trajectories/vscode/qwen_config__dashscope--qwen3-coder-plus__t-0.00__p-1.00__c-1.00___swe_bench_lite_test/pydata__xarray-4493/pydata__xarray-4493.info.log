DISCUSSION
I need to reformat my previous response to match the required structure. The user has specified that I must always include one discussion section followed by one command section. My previous response didn't follow this format, so I need to correct it by providing a proper discussion about what I'm doing and then including a command block, even if no actual command execution is needed for this formatting correction.
