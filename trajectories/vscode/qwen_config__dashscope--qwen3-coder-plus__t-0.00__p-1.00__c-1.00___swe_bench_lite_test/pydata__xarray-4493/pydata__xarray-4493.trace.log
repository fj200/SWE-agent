You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

export PROBLEM_STATEMENT='DataSet.update causes chunked dask DataArray to evalute its values eagerly 
**What happened**:
Used `DataSet.update` to update a chunked dask DataArray, but the DataArray is no longer chunked after the update.

**What you expected to happen**:
The chunked DataArray should still be chunked after the update

**Minimal Complete Verifiable Example**:

```python
foo = xr.DataArray(np.random.randn(3, 3), dims=("x", "y")).chunk()  # foo is chunked
ds = xr.Dataset({"foo": foo, "bar": ("x", [1, 2, 3])})  # foo is still chunked here
ds  # you can verify that foo is chunked
```
```python
update_dict = {"foo": (("x", "y"), ds.foo[1:, :]), "bar": ("x", ds.bar[1:])}
update_dict["foo"][1]  # foo is still chunked
```
```python
ds.update(update_dict)
ds  # now foo is no longer chunked
```

Dataset constructor with DataArray triggers computation
Is it intentional that creating a Dataset with a DataArray and dimension names for a single variable causes computation of that variable?  In other words, why does ```xr.Dataset(dict(a=('"'"'d0'"'"', xr.DataArray(da.random.random(10)))))``` cause the dask array to compute?

A longer example:

```python
import dask.array as da
import xarray as xr
x = da.random.randint(1, 10, size=(100, 25))
ds = xr.Dataset(dict(a=xr.DataArray(x, dims=('"'"'x'"'"', '"'"'y'"'"'))))
type(ds.a.data)
dask.array.core.Array

# Recreate the dataset with the same array, but also redefine the dimensions
ds2 = xr.Dataset(dict(a=(('"'"'x'"'"', '"'"'y'"'"'), ds.a))
type(ds2.a.data)
numpy.ndarray
```
