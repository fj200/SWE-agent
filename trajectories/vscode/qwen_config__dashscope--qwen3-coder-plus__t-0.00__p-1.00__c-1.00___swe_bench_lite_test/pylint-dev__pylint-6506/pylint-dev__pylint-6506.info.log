DISCUSSION
I need to reformat my previous response to match the required structure with discussion and command tags. Since the user pointed out my output wasn't formatted correctly, I should provide a proper response that includes both a discussion section where I think through what I'm doing, and a command section. In this case, since there's no specific task to execute, I'll use a simple echo command to acknowledge the formatting requirement.
